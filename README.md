# Average Age

Write a function called averageAge that takes an object as an argument. The object will look like this:

```javascript
{
  Tony: 42,
  Peter: 18,
  Steve: 104,
  Bruce: 38,
  Thor: 1055
}
```

Loop over the entries in the object to gather the ages, then return the average age. For example:

```javascript
const superHeroes = {
Tony: 42,
Peter: 18,
Steve: 104,
Bruce: 38,
Thor: 1055
};

const avgAge = averageAge(superHeroes); 
console.log(avgAge); // output: 251.4
```

## Submission

Submit a link to your github repo. Make sure you have github pages enabled, I want to be able to go to your site and run the code from there.

### NOTE:

You will be writing HTML/CSS as well. Do not use inline event listening
```html 
<button onclick="testFunction()">...</button>
```

 Make sure you add the event listener inside of your javascript file as discussed in class.
